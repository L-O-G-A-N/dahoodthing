# sorry.
Hey Bullet! I'm contacting you about a ban on Dahood. I'm requesting to be unbanned from Dahood because I accidentally executed a script into the game. I had my executor open (I never hacked on Dahood before this) and I had 2 accounts open 1. my main account, "V1PERWAVES" on Dahood and 2. my alt, "fajardo2222" that was in Meepcity. My exploit has auto attach enabled so i accidentally had my executor on Dahood when I thought it was on Meepcity and I executed a script that lets me walk on walls that INSTANTLY banned me from Dahood and I didn't even notice until when I was looking for why my executor wasn't working then I noticed I had my other Roblox open and found that I was banned. Please Bullet, I never intended on exploiting in Dahood and I would really appreciate if you unbanned me from your game my Roblox ID is: 235627258 and my username is: V1PERWAVES and if this isn't enough i could do GFX or something. Also I don't hack on my main because I don't want it banned so you won't have to worry about me hacking again. :) so once again, PLEASE unban me I've been banned for like, idk a year or more and I can't play with my friends anymore. :(
